# 💧 Water Potability Classification – Group Project on Hyperparameter Tuning

This repository contains our group project for a class assignment where we explored how different **hyperparameters affect the performance of neural networks**. The goal was to predict whether water is safe to drink based on its chemical properties and to analyze how changes in model settings influence results.

## 👥 Team Members
- Nhial Majok Riak
- Placide Imanzi Kabisa
- Prince Rurangwa
- Uwituze Benitha
- Niyongabo Jean Pierre

## 🎯 Objective

- Build individual classification models for water potability prediction.
- Experiment with different **hyperparameter settings**.
- Compare models using performance metrics: **Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy**.
- Reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and why.

## ⚙️ What We Explored

Each team member trained their own model using different:
- Optimizers 
- Regularization methods (
- Dropout rates
- Learning rates
- Early stopping parameters

We then compared the outcomes and discussed the impact of these choices.
